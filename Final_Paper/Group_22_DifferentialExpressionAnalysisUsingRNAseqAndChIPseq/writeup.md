The goal of this chapter is for readers to come away with **four key understandings:**  
1. What is Differential Expression Analysis (DEA) and why do we care about it?
2. What is RNAseq, and how do we use it to do DEA?
3. What is ChIPseq, and how do we use it to do DEA?
4. How does using both RNAseq and ChIPseq together enhance our DEA?

We will go over all these points in detail, and provide a summary at the end. Let's get started with talking about DEA!
