In this chapter, we discuss two technologies: **RNAseq** and **ChIPseq**. We will introduce these technologies with the goal of using them to perform **Differential Expression Analysis (DEA)**.

## What is Differential Expression Analysis (DEA)?

[describe DEA]

## What is RNAseq?

## What is ChIPSeq?

## What do we gain by using both technologies together?
